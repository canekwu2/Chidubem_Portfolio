quotes

If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done
Most of the time, it is not about the task you are doing, its about the people you do it 
You are the sum of people around you
When life gives you lemons make lemonade
I can do this!
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take
